1. Main Goals

  OpenHydraulics aims to be a tool that summarizes and bridges the gap between system design, execution, operation and maintanence of complex industrial systems.

1.1. Serve as a SCADA interface for IAS (Industrial Automationm Systems), displaying the critical pieces of equipment and instruments in an intuitive manner.
1.2. Serve as an instruction set for control, abstracting the complex and/or proprietary programming languages aimed for process and machine automation.
1.3. Monitor and store machine and process critical information for maintenance, ERP and CRM purposes.

2. Desired features

2.1. System and browser agnostic GUI
2.2. Drag and drop system for drawing the hydraulics and synotic pages
2.3. Flowchart programming/system design
2.4. Adaptative and multi-input system (keyboard/mouse, touchscreen, VR/AR, etc)
2.5. Connect to at least the main industrial protocols (Ethernet/IP, Profinet, Modbus, EtherCAT, CAN, OPC, etc.)
2.6. Have a built-in and customizable tool to specify and dimension pieces of equipment (PLCs, relays, valves, etc.)
