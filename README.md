Ciao a tutti!

This is the beginning of a new exploring journey to create a web based, multi plataform and responsive tool to make P&ID (Piping & Instrumentation Diagram) drawing tool.

Although I am new to high level programming languages, my goal is to make this tool not only for drawing, but also monitoring and controlling real processess in real life industry cases, adding a SCADA functionality.

If someone ever sees this and get interested to join the project, that'd be really nice, so just let me know.
If you'd like to take some of my messy code with you, feel free, just let me know, so we could exchange ideas.

Due to my little knowledge regarding git stuff and keeping projects organized, you may find some things a bit disorganized, worry not, an e-mail might solve it.


/** About Me **/

I am a multi-national citizen and moved to seek new opportunities and life fulfilment. You know, why not making our vacation place a new home?

Studying languages is a second hobby, I know a couple romance languages and I am now trying to learn some germanic languages.

Back in the old days, I used to work for an industrial component maker company (like those that make digital thermostats, data loggers and other weird stuff industries need), my position was as the international help-desk guy, nowadays I work for a big group in the... let's say "north".

I've also worked independently for a while, programming some industrial ovens, dealing with PLCs and HMIs but I have always liked the idea of getting everything "web-alike", for better cross platform compatibility and freedom, yeat most of the big automation companies always want you to use their old, cranky, complicated and EXPENSIVE tools.

Digging a bit "deeper" in this web programming world, I found out it wasn't so simple to get it done, but there are some guys out there doing it, like ScadaBR and Bachmann guys. But their style is simply too difficult or too expensive for most, specially in the "south".

That's why I believe OpenHydraulics can be a nice and positive tool for the companies and people in the developing world and it could even evolve to Open (place whatever interesting non-used before project name here)!

Thank you folks and arrivederci alla prossima!
